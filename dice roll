# So far what this code can do:
# -Allows you to select what die type you need
# -Asks how many you need to roll
# -Rolls the amount requested
# -Loops to ask what die type you need, unless you ask it to exit.
# Things I want to learn:
# -How can I make the outputs of the dice roll add itself. For example I need 2 10 sided dice to be rolled.
# The output is 10 and 3. In what direction should I take the code to store that info and then output the sum
# -How to add modifiers that can later be used to add to a roll. I definitely have an
# understanding on this one. Set the variables for Strength/Dexterity/etc to be a user input
# and then have it recalled later on if asked for such as an attack roll.
